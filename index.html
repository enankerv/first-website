				About Me! <br>
				Hi I am Ethan Nankervis. I am a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy studying Information Systems. I moved to the United States in 2011 from Melbourne,
				Australia. Since living in The States I have lived in New York, New Jersey, and Ohio. All of these moves have taught me to see the niuanced differences 
				in culture not only between different countries but also between regions within countries. Observing these differences has taught me to appreciate different
				cultures. I love travelling and experiencing different cultures through their landmarks and food.
				<br><br>
				Speaking of food, I am a huge foodie. I've loved cooking since I was little and being alone at college that passion has only grown! I think that the best
				way to get to know someone is over a bowl of pasta, and being able to cook and have friends over to eat and talk is honestly the best part of cooking!
